=====

Release Date: 2019-09-20

* Support Python 3.8.
* Update Cython to 0.29.13 for support Python 3.8.
* Some small optimizations.


0.6.1
======

Release Date: 2019-01-25

This release is for mitigating pain caused by v0.6.0 reduced max input limits
for security reason.

* ``unpackb(data)`` configures ``max_*_len`` options from ``len(data)``,
  instead of static default sizes.

* ``Unpacker(max_buffer_len=N)`` configures ``max_*_len`` options from ``N``,
  instead of static default sizes.

* ``max_bin_len``, ``max_str_len``, and ``max_ext_len`` are deprecated.
  Since this is minor release, it's document only deprecation.


0.6.0
======

Release Date: 2018-11-30

This release contains some backward incompatible changes for security reason (DoS).

Important changes
-----------------

* unpacker: Default value of input limits are smaller than before to avoid DoS attack.
  If you need to handle large data, you need to specify limits manually. (#319)

* Unpacker doesn't wrap underlaying ``ValueError`` (including ``UnicodeError``) into
  ``UnpackValueError``.  If you want to catch all exception during unpack, you need
  to use ``try ... except Exception`` with minimum try code block. (#323, #233)

* ``PackValueError`` and ``PackOverflowError`` are also removed.  You need to catch
  normal ``ValueError`` and ``OverflowError``. (#323, #233)

* Unpacker has ``strict_map_key`` option now.  When it is true, only bytes and str
  (unicode in Python 2) are allowed for map keys.  It is recommended to avoid
  hashdos.  Default value of this option is False for backward compatibility reason.
  But it will be changed True in 1.0. (#296, #334)

Other changes
-------------

* Extension modules are merged.  There is ``msgpack._cmsgpack`` instead of
  ``msgpack._packer`` and ``msgpack._unpacker``. (#314, #328)

* Add ``Unpacker.getbuffer()`` method. (#320)

* unpacker: ``msgpack.StackError`` is raised when input data contains too
  nested data. (#331)

* unpacker: ``msgpack.FormatError`` is raised when input data is not valid
  msgpack format. (#331)


0.5.6
======

* Fix fallback.Unpacker.feed() dropped unused data from buffer (#287)
* Resurrect fallback.unpack() and _unpacker.unpack().
  They were removed at 0.5.5 but it breaks backward compatibility. (#288, #290)

0.5.5
======

* Fix memory leak in pure Python Unpacker.feed() (#283)
* Fix unpack() didn't support `raw` option (#285)

0.5.4
======

* Undeprecate ``unicode_errors`` option. (#278)

0.5.3
======

* Fixed regression when passing ``unicode_errors`` to Packer but not ``encoding``. (#277)

0.5.2
======

* Add ``raw`` option to Unpacker.  It is preferred way than ``encoding`` option.

* Packer.pack() reset buffer on exception (#274)


0.5.1
======

* Remove FutureWarning about use_bin_type option (#271)

0.5.0
======

There are some deprecations.  Please read changes carefully.

Changes
-------

* Drop Python 2.6 and ~3.4 support.  Python 2.7 and 3.5+ are supported.

* Deprecate useless custom exceptions.  Use ValueError instead of PackValueError,
  Exception instead of PackException and UnpackException, etc...
  See msgpack/exceptions.py

* Add *strict_types* option to packer.  It can be used to serialize subclass of
  builtin types.  For example, when packing object which type is subclass of dict,
  ``default()`` is called.  ``default()`` is called for tuple too.

* Pure Python implementation supports packing memoryview object.

* Support packing bytearray.

* Add ``Unpacker.tell()``.  And ``write_bytes`` option is deprecated.

Incompatible Changes
--------------------

Changes
-------

* fallback.Unpacker.feed() supports bytearray.

* Unpacker may read unfilled internal buffer.

0.4.0
=====
:release date: 2013-10-21

Incompatible Changes
--------------------

* Raises TypeError instead of ValueError when packer receives unsupported type.

Changes
-------

* Support New msgpack spec.


0.3.0
=====

Incompatible Changes
--------------------

* Default value of ``use_list`` is ``True`` for now. (It was ``False`` for 0.2.x)
  You should pass it explicitly for compatibility to 0.2.x.
* `Unpacker.unpack()` and some unpack methods now raise `OutOfData` instead of
  `StopIteration`. `StopIteration` is used for iterator protocol only.

Changes
-------
* Pure Python fallback module is added. (thanks to bwesterb)
* Add ``.skip()`` method to ``Unpacker`` (thanks to jnothman)
* Add capturing feature. You can pass the writable object to
  ``Unpacker.unpack()`` as a second parameter.
* Add ``Packer.pack_array_header`` and ``Packer.pack_map_header``.
  These methods only pack header of each type.
* Add ``autoreset`` option to ``Packer`` (default: True).
  Packer doesn't return packed bytes and clear internal buffer.

0.2.4
=====
:release date: 2012-12-22

Bugs fixed

Changes
-------
* Add ``use_single_float`` option to ``Packer``. When it is true, packs float
  object in single precision format.

Bugs fixed
----------
* ``unpack()`` didn't restores gc state when it called with gc disabled.
  ``unpack()`` doesn't control gc now instead of restoring gc state collectly.
  User can control gc state when gc cause performance issue.

* ``Unpacker``'s ``read_size`` option didn't used.

0.2.1
=====
:release date: 2012-08-20

Changes
-------
* Add ``max_buffer_size`` parameter to Unpacker. It limits internal buffer size
  and allows unpack data from untrusted source safely.

* Unpacker's buffer reallocation algorithm is less greedy now. It cause performance
  decrease in rare case but memory efficient and don't allocate than ``max_buffer_size``.

Bugs fixed
----------
* Fix msgpack didn't work on SPARC Solaris. It was because choosing wrong byteorder
  on compilation time. Use ``sys.byteorder`` to get correct byte order.
  Very thanks to Chris Casey for giving test environment to me.
